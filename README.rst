Twitter Bootstrap Theme, for Pinax
==================================

A theme for Pinax 0.9 based on Twitter's open source Bootstrap framework.


Quick Start
-----------

Include "pinax-theme-bootstrap" in your requirements file and include
"pinax_theme_bootstrap" and "django_forms_bootstrap" (which is installed alongside
this theme) in your INSTALLED APPS.

Make sure both template loaders and staticfiles finders includes
app directories.

Site name comes from Sites fixture.

Your "site_base.html" should extend "theme_bootstrap/base.html" and should provide
"footer" and "nav" blocks (the latter should just be a ul of li of a links).

Your pages should have blocks "head_title" and "body" and should extend
"site_base.html".

The url name "home" should be defined as the homepage.


Upgrade Notes
-------------

- With newer versions of Bootstrap a light status bar is now default. If you'd like
  to use the darker navbar, simply override the `navbar_class` block in your
  site_base.html to something like the following (note we include the `fixed-top`
  class in this block by default, but it's also optional): ::

    {% block navbar_class %}navbar-inverse navbar-fixed-top{% endblock %}

- Base templates: To enable multiple themes to be used within a single site, base
  templates are now located under the "theme_bootstrap" folder. We will continue to
  provide base templates at the root path for backward compatibility, but these will
  likely be removed in a future version and you should update your site_base.html to
  extend from "theme_bootstrap/base.html".

- Forms Rendering: Versions prior to 2.0.3 included template tags for forms rendering.
  This has now been moved out to a new app, django-forms-bootstrap. You'll need to add
  this app to your `INSTALLED_APPS` as "django_forms_bootstrap".


Requirements
------------

This theme is officially supported when used in conjuction with Pinax 0.9.
If using the theme with Django < 1.4, you will need to install a recent
version of django-staticfiles as we use the `{% render %}` template tag.


Forms
-----

This theme makes use of django-forms-bootstrap for simple forms support.
Make sure you have the latest version of django-forms-bootstrap installed
in your virtualenv (if you install this theme with pip it will be installed
automatically) and add "django_forms_bootstrap" to your `INSTALLED_APPS`.

To style forms, add the following to the top of your template ::
    
    {% load bootstrap_tags %}

and include your form using something like the following markup: ::
    
    <form>
        <legend>My Form</legend>
        {% csrf_token %}
        {{ form|as_bootstrap }}
        <div class="form-actions">
          <a href="#back" class="btn">Go back</a>
          <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Save changes</button>
        </div>
    </form>

Bootstrap includes styles for four types of forms. To change the display of
your form, add one of the following class attributes to your form tag:


==================  ================   ==============================================================
        Name             Class                        Description
==================  ================   ==============================================================
Vertical (default)  .form-vertical     Stacked, left-aligned labels over controls
Horizontal          .form-horizontal   Float left, right-aligned labels on same line as controls
Inline              .form-inline       Left-aligned label and inline-block controls for compact style
Search              .form-search       Extra-rounded text input for a typical search aesthetic
==================  ================   ==============================================================


Navigation
----------

To modify your site's navigation bar, implement the "nav" block in
your site_base.html using the following pattern: ::

    <ul class="nav">
        <li id="tab_first">
            <a href="#">First Link</a>
        </li>
        <li id="tab_second">
            <a href="#">Second Link</a>
        </li>
        <li id="tab_third" class="dropdown">
            <a href="#" class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown">
                Some Dropdown Menu
                <b class="caret"></b>
            </a>
            <ul class="dropdown-menu">
                <li><a href="#">Some Link</a></li>
                <li><a href="#">Another Link</a></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>


Responsive Grid
---------------

Bootstrap's responsive grid makes designing layouts that work well on every
device a snap. We've included the the responsive stylesheet in this theme by
default. If you'd like to remove this from your site, include the following
two in your site_base.html: ::

    {# unset the viewport, telling mobile devices to scale your site #}
    {% block viewport %}{% endblock %}

    {# include all default stylesheets except the responsive grid #}
    {% block style_base %}
        <link href="{% static "pinax/css/theme.css" %}" rel="stylesheet">
        <link href="{% static "bootstrap/css/bootstrap.css" %}" rel="stylesheet">
        {% block extra_style %}{% endblock %}
    {% endblock %}

Pagination
----------

This theme supports both django-pagination_ and Django builtin pagination.
See PaginationTemplate_ for information how to switch between them.


Roadmap
-------

The 2.x line of `pinax-theme-bootstrap` with support for Pinax 0.9 will soon
be phased out of major updates. We will be releasing a 3.x line that will
break backwards compatibility but fully support Pinax 1.0 projects. This
is a change towards a more semantic versioning strategy in lieu of merely
indicating which version of Bootstrap media is included.
