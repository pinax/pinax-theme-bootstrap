A Pinax theme based on Twitter's Bootstrap
==========================================


Quick Start
-----------

Include "pinax-theme-bootstrap" in your requirements file and
"pinax_theme_bootstrap" in your INSTALLED APPS.

Make sure both template loaders and staticfiles finders includes
app directories.

Site name comes from Sites fixture.

Your "site_base.html" should extend "theme_base.html" and should provide
"footer" and "nav" blocks (the latter should just be a ul of li of a links).

Your pages should have blocks "head_title" and "body" and should extend
"site_base.html".

The url name "home" should be defined as the homepage.


Forms
-----

To style forms, 
    
    {% load bootstrap_tags %}

and do something like:
    
    <form method="POST" action="">
        {% csrf_token %}
        <fieldset>
            {{ form|as_bootstrap }}
        </fieldset>
        <div class="actions">
            <button type="submit" class="btn primary">Submit</button>
        </div>
    </form>


Bootstrap layout
----------------

http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/#layouts
By default, the fixed layout is used. If you want to use the fluid layout add:
    "pinax_theme_bootstrap.context_processors.bootstrap_layout"
to TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS and
    BOOTSTRAP_LAYOUT = 'fluid'
in the settings.py file.


Todo / Issues
-------------

* build additional templates for other apps (possibly as add-ons)
* include LESS source files here
